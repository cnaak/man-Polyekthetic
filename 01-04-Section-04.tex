\section{Example Application}

    Consider         a         substance         whose         Helmholtz          characteristic
    function~\cite{1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley} in reduced coordinates is given by:
    %
    \begin{equation}
        a_r = \frac{8T_r}{3}\left[
                  \phi\left(1 - \log T_r\right) - \log(3v_r - 1)
              \right] - \frac{3}{v_r},
        \label{eq:ex.aTv}
    \end{equation}
    %
    \noindent where $a_r \equiv a / (P_{cr}v_{cr})$ is the reduced  specific  Helmholtz  energy,
    $T_r \equiv T / T_{cr}$ is the reduced temperature, $\phi \equiv \bar{c}_v / \bar{R}$  is  a
    constant dimensionless isochoric specific heat, $v_r \equiv  v  /  v_{cr}$  is  the  reduced
    specific volume, $P_{cr}$ is the substance critical  pressure,  $T_{cr}$  is  the  substance
    critical temperature, and $v_{cr} = Z_{cr}(RT_{cr}/P_{cr})$ is the substance model  critical
    specific volume, with $Z_{cr} = 3/8$.

    The  Equation  of  State,  EoS,  of  this   substance   is   obtained   by   differentiating
    Eq.~(\ref{eq:ex.aTv}) partially with respect to $v_r$~\cite{1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley}:
    %
    \begin{align}
        P_r & = \parxyz{a_r}{v_r}{T_r} & \rightharpoondown\\
        P_r & = \frac{8T_r}{3v_r - 1} - \frac{3}{v_r^2}, \label{eq:ex.EoS}
    \end{align}
    %
    \noindent where $P_r \equiv P / P_{cr}$ is the reduced pressure, and $P$  the  (dimensional)
    pressure. Eq.~(\ref{eq:ex.EoS}) is  known  as  the  universal~\cite{1899-MaxwellJC-Longmans}
    van-der-Waals~\cite{2006-BejanA-Wiley,                           2013-CengelYA+BolesMA-AMGH,
    1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley} equation of state in reduced coordinates.

    The entropy of this substance is obtained by differentiating Eq.~(\ref{eq:ex.aTv}) partially
    with respect to $T_r$~\cite{1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley}:
    %
    \begin{align}
        s_r & = -\parxyz{a_r}{T_r}{v_r} & \rightharpoondown\\
        s_r & = \frac{8}{3}\left[\phi\log T_r + \log(3v_r - 1)\right], \label{eq:ex.sTv}
    \end{align}
    %
    \noindent where $s_r \equiv s(T_{cr} / P_{cr}v_{cr})$, is the reduced  specific  entropy  of
    the substance and $s$ is the (dimensional) specific entropy.

    Let
    %
    \begin{equation}
        \omega_r \equiv v_r - \frac{1}{3},
        \label{eq:def.omega}
    \end{equation}
    %
    \noindent be the reduced specific voids volume---since the minimum  van-der-Waals  substance
    specific reduced volume, $v_{r,min} = 1/3$, for which $\omega_{r,min} = 0$.

    Therefore, \emph{isentropic processes} in this const-$c_v$, van-der-Waals substance, between
    states $(T_{r1}, \omega_{r1})$ and $(T_{r2}, \omega_{r2})$ are given by:
    %
    \begin{align}
        s_{r2} - s_{r1} & = 0 \qquad\rightharpoondown\\
        \phi\log T_{r2} + \log\omega_{r2} & = \phi\log T_{r1} + \log\omega_{r1},
    \end{align}
    %
    \noindent which, rearraged, leads to
